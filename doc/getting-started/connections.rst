===========

PyVista is a powerful tool that researchers can harness to create compelling,
integrated visualizations of large datasets in an intuitive, Pythonic manner.

PyVista is used across science and engineering disciplines by a diverse
community to visualize data/models in 3D, generate publication-quality
illustrations, automate analysis workflows, and build custom applications
leveraging PyVista's 3D capabilities.

Here are a few open-source projects that leverage PyVista:


Engineering
-----------

* pyleecan_: Electrical engineering open-source software providing a user-friendly, unified, flexible simulation framework for the multiphysic design and optimization of electrical machines and drives.
* pymapdl_: Pythonic interface to Ansys MAPDL.
* pyprocar_: A Python library for electronic structure pre/post-processing.
* AeroSandbox_: Plug-and-play analysis tools for aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, trajectory design, and much more.
* Ptera_: Software for nalyzing flapping-wing flight.


Geosciences
-----------

* GemPy_: 3D structural geological modeling software using PyVista for 3D visualization and interaction.
* discretize_: Discretization tools for finite volume and inverse problems. ``discretize`` provides ``toVTK`` methods that return PyVista versions of their data types for `creating compelling visualizations`_.
* gemgis_: Spatial data processing for geomodeling.
* gimly_: Geophysical inversion and modeling library.
* PVGeo_: Python package of VTK-based algorithms to analyze geoscientific data and models. PyVista is used to make the inputs and outputs of PVGeo's algorithms more accessible.
* omfvista_: 3D visualization for the Open Mining Format (omf). PyVista provides the foundation for this library's visualization.


Many More
---------

* VesselVio_: Analysis and visualization of segmented vasculature datasets.
* pymeshfix_: Python/Cython wrapper of Marco Attene's wonderful, award-winning MeshFix_ software.
* tetgen_: Python Interface to Hang Si's C++ TetGen Library.
* itkwidgets_: Interactive Jupyter widgets to visualize images, point sets, and meshes in 2D and 3D. Supports all PyVista mesh types.
* mne-python_: MNE: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) in Python.
